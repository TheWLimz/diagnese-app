1. **`Training.csv`** is a raw data dataset we downloaded at **Kaggle** with the title [**DISEASE PREDICTION USING MACHINE LEARNING WITH GUI**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/neelima98/disease-prediction-using-machine-learning?select=Training.csv) which we have translated into **Bahasa Indonesia** where this dataset contains **131 Feature Columns** in the form of symptoms and **1 Label Column** as a prognosis with **41 types of Disease**. This dataset will be used in model training which will be split into **Training set** and **Validation set**.
2. **`Testing.csv`** is a raw data dataset we downloaded at **Kaggle** with the title [**DISEASE PREDICTION USING MACHINE LEARNING WITH GUI**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/neelima98/disease-prediction-using-machine-learning?select=Testing.csv) which we have translated into **Bahasa Indonesia** where this dataset contains **131 Feature Columns** in the form of symptoms and **1 Label Column** as a prognosis with **41 types of Disease**. This dataset will be used to **Testing** how well the model predicted.
3. **`Deskripsi_dan_Dokter.csv`** contains list of **Deskripsi** and also **Dokter Spesialis** which will be used using conditioning based on the output of the model prediction result.
